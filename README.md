# Twitter_Bot_Or_Not

In this project, I am going build a classifier to predict a new Twitter account as a bot or human account.

### Software and libraries required:

  * Python 3
  * Spyder IDE
  * Numpy
  * Pandas
  * Scikit-learn
  * Regular Expressions
  * Datetime

> Alternatively, you can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which comes preinstalled with all the above software and libraries.

### Data:

The dataset for this project was obtained using the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/). The dataset contains the details of approximately 3500 twitter accounts - half the accounts are bots while the other half are human accounts.

### Key Features:

  * Screen name
  * Description
  * Followers Count
  * Friends Count
  * Language
  * Verified
  * Ratio of status count to number of days since account was created

### Algorithms used and its results:

Note: Accuracy is chosen as the evaluation metric.

  + Naive Bayes Classifier - Accuracy = 68%
  + Decision Tree Classifier - Accuracy = 88%
  + RandoM Forest Classifier - Accuracy = 96%

> This classifier achieved 97.22% accuracy when competed in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/twitter-bot-classification/leaderboard).
